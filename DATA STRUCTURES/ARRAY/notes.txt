techniques:-

i> segregation O(n)
ii> insertion O(n^2)

both of these require two pointers technique

segregation does not keep the order same but insertion does.

we can use segregation if at least one part contains only fixed value like moving zeros to the end.

what is segregation?

suppose we have to bring good values to the start and bad values to the end.Now we keep a pointer j which points to the position of the next good value.
i points to the current position while traversing. we initialise j as -1. If at any pos i we find a good value we increment j and swap values of i & j.

what is insertion?

similar to the segregation we start with j = -1. If we find a good val at i we increment j and we shift all the values from j to i-1 one position to the right and then put the good value at j.
