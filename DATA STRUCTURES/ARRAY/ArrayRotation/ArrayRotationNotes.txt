1.IMPORTANT!
After k LEFT-rotations of an array, the array starts form kth index.So it is possible to quickly print the rotated array starting from kth index with rotational increment.
	For RIGHT-rotations the array starts from (n-k)th index.
	This process doesn't change the array and takes O(1) space and O(n) time.

2. n rotations on an array returns the initial array itself.So we use (mod n) for more than n rotations.

3.IMPORTANT!
A famous method of array rotation or adding subarray(from start) to the end is :
	create a temporary array double of our array's size and copy our array to the temporary one twice.Then copy the necessary part of the temporary array to our array.
	But this requires extra space.
